# fNIRSvis
Visualization tool for functional near-infrared spectroscopy. 
Due to the nature fNIRS signals, analyzing process is usually involved in manimupating mutidimensional matrix such as channels, sessions, trials and especially the types of hemoglobin. This characteristics usually causes lots of trouble to the investigators to inspect signals' trend at the beginning of the research, which is crucial for further processing, exploring potential feature hidden in the signals. Moreover, since fNIRS is relatively new modality in brain research, the is limited number of toolbox designated to analyze fNIRS signals. 

In this small programm, fNIRS signals can be loaded from text files which including 3 following files:
* subject_oxygenated_hemoglobin.TXT
* subject_deoxygenated_hemoglobin.TXT
* subject_label.TXT

Next, the signals are visualized in all channels at the same time. It also allows user to see signal trial by trial using control buttons. In this program, we also show the raw signals and the processed (bandpass filtered) signals side by side.
